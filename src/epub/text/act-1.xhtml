			<p>Scene: Country public-house or shebeen, very rough and untidy. There is a sort of counter on the right with shelves, holding many bottles and jugs, just seen above it. Empty barrels stand near the counter. At back, a little to left of counter, there is a door into the open air, then, more to the left, there is a settle with shelves above it, with more jugs, and a table beneath a window. At the left there is a large open fireplace, with turf fire, and a small door into inner room. <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Pegeen</b>, a wild-looking but fine girl, of about twenty, is writing at table. She is dressed in the usual peasant dress.</p>
